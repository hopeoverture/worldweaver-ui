## üö® CRITICAL SECURITY FIXES (Complete Within 1 Week)

### [ ] 1. Input Sanitization & XSS Prevention
**Files:** `src/components/templates/`, `src/components/entities/`
**Risk:** Template user content stored as JSON without sanitization
- [ ] Install DOMPurify: `npm install dompurify @types/dompurify`
- [ ] Create sanitization utility in `src/lib/security.ts`
- [ ] Sanitize all user HTML/markdown in template fields before display
- [ ] Add validation for JSON field structure in entity forms
- [ ] Test XSS vectors: `<script>alert('xss')</script>`, `javascript:` URLs
- [ ] Verify CSP headers block inline scripts in production

### [ ] 2. Environment Variable Security
**Files:** `.env.local.example`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
**Risk:** Service role key exposure, missing validation
- [ ] Create `.env.local.example` with safe placeholder values
- [ ] Add environment validation in `src/lib/env.ts`:
  ```typescript
  const requiredEnvVars = ['NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL', 'NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY']
  // Validate all required vars are present and non-empty
  ```
- [ ] Add CI step to validate environment variables
- [ ] Document service role key rotation process
- [ ] Verify no secrets in git history: `git log --all --full-history -- "*.env*"`

### [ ] 3. Error Boundaries & Graceful Failures
**Files:** `src/app/layout.tsx`, `src/components/`
**Risk:** Client crashes expose sensitive information
- [ ] Install error boundary library: `npm install react-error-boundary`
- [ ] Wrap app root in error boundary with fallback UI
- [ ] Add per-route error boundaries for critical paths
- [ ] Replace console.error with structured logging in production
- [ ] Test error scenarios: network failures, malformed API responses
- [ ] Verify no sensitive data in error messages

## ‚ö° HIGH PRIORITY FIXES (Complete Within 2 Weeks)

### [ ] 4. Authentication Error Handling
**Files:** `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx:57`, `src/lib/auth/server.ts:18`
**Issue:** Silent error handling, empty catch blocks
- [ ] Replace `console.error` with proper error state in AuthContext
- [ ] Add user-facing error messages for auth failures
- [ ] Remove empty catch blocks in server auth functions
- [ ] Add retry logic for transient auth failures
- [ ] Test auth error scenarios: invalid tokens, network timeouts
- [ ] Implement session timeout with user notification

### [ ] 5. API Response Type Safety
**Files:** `src/lib/types.ts`, `src/app/api/*/route.ts`
**Issue:** Using `Error | null` instead of proper union types
- [ ] Define proper API error response types:
  ```typescript
  type ApiResponse<T> = 
    | { success: true; data: T }
    | { success: false; error: { code: string; message: string } }
  ```
- [ ] Update all API routes to return consistent error format
- [ ] Update frontend to handle typed error responses
- [ ] Add error code constants for different failure types
- [ ] Test error response consistency across all endpoints

### [ ] 6. Rate Limiting Scalability
**Files:** `middleware.ts:25-45`
**Issue:** In-memory Map won't scale in production
- [ ] Research Vercel Edge Runtime limitations for external stores
- [ ] Implement database-backed rate limiting OR
- [ ] Use Vercel Edge Config for distributed rate limiting
- [ ] Add rate limit headers to responses: `X-RateLimit-Remaining`
- [ ] Document rate limiting behavior for API consumers
- [ ] Test rate limiting under concurrent load

### [ ] 7. Database Performance & Indexing
**Files:** `supabase/migrations/`
**Issue:** Missing indexes for common query patterns
- [ ] Analyze query patterns in `src/lib/services/supabaseWorldService.ts`
- [ ] Create migration for performance indexes:
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_entities_world_updated 
  ON entities(world_id, updated_at DESC);
  CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_templates_system_name 
  ON templates(name) WHERE is_system = true;
  ```
- [ ] Add composite indexes for common filter combinations
- [ ] Test query performance with large datasets (1000+ entities)
- [ ] Document expected query performance SLAs
