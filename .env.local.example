# Copy this to .env.local and update with your actual values
# SECURITY: Never commit .env.local to git - it contains sensitive credentials

# --- Supabase (Required) ---
# Found in Supabase Dashboard → Settings → API
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.your-anon-key-here

# Found in Supabase Dashboard → Settings → API (service_role)
# WARNING: This key has full database access - keep secure!
# Used only by trusted server routes (e.g., admin seeder)
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.your-service-role-key-here

# --- Admin Seeder (Dev/Ops) ---
# SECURITY: Use a strong random string (32+ characters)
# Pass as header x-admin-token or ?token= when calling the seed endpoint
SEED_ADMIN_TOKEN=your-random-admin-token-32-chars-minimum
# Base URL of the running app for seed script
SEED_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
# Gate the admin seed route in production (keep false unless you know what you're doing)
# ADMIN_SEED_ENABLED=false

# --- Local API Tests ---
# Base URL for API test script (scripts/test-api-endpoints.js)
API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
# Test credentials for exercising authenticated API endpoints
# SECURITY: Use real but non-production test accounts
TEST_EMAIL=test@example.com
TEST_PASSWORD=test-password-123
TEST_INVITE_EMAIL=invite-test@example.com

# --- Security Notes ---
# 1. Never use these placeholder values in production
# 2. Rotate service role keys if they are ever exposed
# 3. Use different passwords for test accounts
# 4. Keep ADMIN_SEED_ENABLED=false in production
# 5. Verify no .env files are tracked in git: git ls-files | grep "\.env"

# --- Framework Notes ---
# NextAuth is NOT used. Auth is handled by Supabase via @supabase/ssr.
# DATABASE_URL is not required by the UI; use Supabase hosted Postgres.
# OPENAI_API_KEY is optional and not used yet.
