# Changelog â€” fix/initial-errors

Date: 2025-09-11
Branch: `fix/initial-errors`

## Summary
Small, low-risk lint and type hygiene fixes applied to prepare the project for CI (zero ESLint errors/warnings). Changes are conservative and preserve runtime behavior.

## What I changed (files and rationale)
- `src/components/membership/MembershipTab.tsx`
  - Added a single-line ESLint suppression for `@next/next/no-img-element` on the avatar `<img>` and wrapped the comment+img in a fragment to keep JSX valid. Reason: intentional use of external avatar URLs; small scoped exception.

- `src/components/worlds/CreateWorldModal.tsx`
  - Removed unused `newWorld` assignment (call `addWorld` without storing the return). Fixes `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars`.

- `src/lib/mockData.ts`
  - Marked large unused template fields as intentionally unused and removed an unused map index param. Keeps mock data intact while removing noisy warnings.

- `src/lib/services/worldService.ts`
  - Removed an unused import alias and removed unused function parameters; adjusted internal references accordingly. Keeps public API compatible while removing unused-symbol warnings.

- `src/lib/store.ts`
  - Removed an unused temporary owner lookup used only for side-effect-free logic to silence unused-var warnings while preserving transfer logic.

- `src/lib/supabase/server.ts`
  - Replaced `catch (error)` with `catch {}` in a couple of small try/catch blocks where the caught error wasn't used. This silences no-unused-vars while retaining behavior.

## Commands run to validate
- ESLint (strict, fail on any warnings):

```powershell
npx eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx --max-warnings 0
```

- (Earlier) TypeScript check (noEmit):

```powershell
npx tsc --noEmit
```

- (Optional) Dev server (manual smoke test):

```powershell
npm run dev
```

## Verification
- ESLint: passed with `--max-warnings 0` after the edits (0 errors, 0 warnings).
- TypeScript: no new compile errors introduced by these edits in prior checks.

## Notes & rationale
- Avatar `<img>`: decided to add a narrow inline suppression because migrating to `next/image` requires extra configuration and risk; suppression is limited to a single line.
- Many changes were small naming/unused-var fixes, not behavior changes.

## Next recommended steps
- Optional: replace inline `<img>` usage with `next/image` if you want automatic optimization and to follow Next.js recommendations.
- Optional: a follow-up typing pass to replace `unknown` and looser types in the DB/supabase layer with precise domain types.
